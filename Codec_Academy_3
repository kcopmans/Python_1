# Explicit String Conversion

print "I have " + str(2) + " coconuts!"

"""
The str() method converts non-strings into strings. 
In the above example, you convert the number 2 into a string and then you concatenate the strings 
together just like in the previous exercise.

# String formatting with %

"""
When you want to print a variable with a string, there is a better method than concatenating strings together.
name = "Mike"
print "Hello %s" % (name)
The % operator after a string is used to combine a string with variables. 
The % operator will replace a %s in the string with the string variable that comes after it.
